<p> life is what you want it to be, and once you claim to be a winner, that is what you achieve in with GOD'S GRACE. It was so cool for me to advert my services to the world, and through the advert, i recieved a call from a person and he introduced him self and told me that he was watching my advert and he was intrested in my service and decided to write down my number and call, to tell me his promblems and see if i could help.</P>
<P> He told me that he had a son who ran from home because he was being told to go a seminary school. He wanted to arrage a meeting so that we can talk more on this promblem. The next day, we were able to meet and we talked and i told him that i can do the work if he is willing to bring hi compromise. I said this because i had seen the promblem. What could have been the promblem that led his son to run away. Some time, the parents can be to Decisive and selfish.</p>
<p> He gave me the niumber to of his son and i talked talked to him. I told him that i was going to help him and convice his parents to leave him and do what he wish to do.</P
<p> He agreed to meet me and i told him that saturday would be better of which he agreed. So it did not take long, saturday came and we mananged to meet. To have an effective communication with him and in order for him be an active listener, i had to start with what he wanted most. He told me that he wanted to be a<b> Teacher</b>, and his parents wanted him to be a <b>Priest</b>. </p>
<p> After hearing this, i told him that you were right in your opinion but, again you were wrong to run away from Home. He told me that he was going to go back home until they accept his desire. I wanted to help him, and to help the parents as well. But unfortunately, i was afraid, that one side was going to loose. I told him to go backand i will communicate with him afeter talking to his parents. I called his parents and decided to meet them both of them, and they agreed to meet me.</p>
<p> We met and i had to be open and told them the trueth. First, i told them how selfish they are. And i told them that it was not their son's fault, but it was them who pushed him to run away from home. I told them that it is good to be a priest when you want to be, because being a priest, is job a job of GOD and it rquires intense consetration in faith. SO i told them to go and talk to his to the seminary and see, compare the facts. And later come back to me if they want. I gave them two days to get back to me.</p>
<p> They later came back and asked me to tell their son to come back home, they had realised their mistake and their had neglected their son. BRIAN, later went back home and he went and sturded what we wanted. My advice, Dear parents, please, always respect your childrens desire/dreams, and support them.</p.
