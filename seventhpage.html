<h1><b><i><u>AMINAH</U></i></b></h1>
</header>
<P> Who is Aminah?
AMINA, is a girl who was abardoned by her mother after giving birth to her. Amina, approched me, and told me that she wanted my help. I gave her a chance and appointment to meet on frinday evening. She came and we started talking,, she told me how she grew in an ophanage, and how she got an opportunity to go abroad and sturdy from there. After she completed her sturdies, she came back to Uganda and started working to the same ophanage as the Managing Director of the Ophanage.
She told me that after two years of working, she recieved a call from a strange number and the voice was for a woman and this woman claimed to be her mother. She told me that she almost faited, and switched off the phone. Later, this woman called a gain and asked to meet her and they talk. So she was confused, she did not know what to do, and decided to come see me.</P>
<p> I told her that, she shold give her a chance and meet her and hear her out and also to ask her the most important quesion........and that is why did she do what she did?. I told her not to be hash while talking to her if she is her mother, she deserves respect no matter what she did.</P>
<P> I told her that, in this world, Things happen with a reason, and GOD konws why?. So, i told her not to think too much and over react. I told her to listen to her and afer they shold go for a DNA test. Aminah, was short of words, and i told her that even if you go and ask a sheikh, he will tell you the same thing. Parents are the<B> GODS OF EARTH</B> and we the children should give them respect and whatever they want as long as we can. I encouraged her so much to go and talk to her and she should not allow her hatred over the reason why she abardoned.</p>
<p> Aminah, agreed to go and meet her and later she called me and tild me how she resembled her so much and the reason why she abardoned her. She told me that her mother gave birth to her at the age of 16 and the man who got her pregnant denied the resposibilities. She told me how hard it was for her mother to let her go in such a way. That's why she brought her near the ophanage and left her there with a letter that she hsd written narrating all the story of how she got the pregnant and why she is leaving her there. She even wrote the Name<b> AMINAH </b>. And this is what made AMINAH to change and accept her as her mother and she told me how she was crying and kneling down asking her daughter to forgiver her.</p>
<p> AMINAH, was really happy and i asked her if she can bring her along for a lunch and the BILL was going to be in me. She agreed and we mananged to her lunch together, and i also could not imagine the resemblance. AMINAH, was happy and she could not imagine that she had a mother. My advice, please, parents who through awy awy your babies, please you should stop. Because it can traumatise the kid up to his or her adult and beyond. I thank you for reading all of my pages and i want to wish all the best and i hope you have leant something this small experience of mine.</P>
