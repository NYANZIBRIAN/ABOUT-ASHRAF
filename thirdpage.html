<h1><b><i><u>sarah</U></i></b></h1>

<p>One day, i started prying to the teachers to see if i could find the cause of the reason why sarah, told me that the teachers hate her.
I went i ahead and asked one of the teacher, and i found that most of the teachers have the best teaching ways to teache the pupils. And this, proved me wrong on the other issues like i had thought earlier that could be the reason why sarah had that feeling.</p>
<p>I had spent time without talking to my friend sarah. So the next day, we met and she seemed to be very happy and i this forced me to asked the reason behind her smile. She told me that it was working, the idea i gave her to start trusting people. she said that she is really improving and this showed me that i was really doing a good job.</p>
<p>I had to go ahead look for pupil like who needed help. And supprisingly, i did not find any of the kinds who had an illness like that one of sarah, and all the kinds were normal and they were copperating in a good way the their teachers.</p>
<p>I told the teachers what i had found in one of their kids. And they were very supprised to hear such an illness. And i told them that i was lucky to have a kid like sarah who managed to fight it so quickly. I told them that it is not easy for the kinds who have that illness to get healed easily. Some even go a therapy to over come it, it takes them some good time.</p>
<p>Eventually, after i went through. I asked the principle to call for the meeting of all the staff. And in the meeting, i had every good time with them and emphasised on taking care of the kids as their own.<p/>
<p> My time was over at that nursery school and i left all of them happy and sarah had started leaving a happy life and her parents noticed that their daughter had changed. They came at school to find out the person who their daughter was talking abaut. I got a chance and met them, we talked and they thanked me for what i had done for their daughter. They even invited me to come to their house and have dinner with them. They seeme to be good people and resposimble.</p>
<p> The principle was very happy with me and wanted me not to go but i had to go and start up something for my self. I had atleast how my service could help others. She had no choice other to let me know how she was proud of me and appreciated the way i handdled  sarah's case.</p>
