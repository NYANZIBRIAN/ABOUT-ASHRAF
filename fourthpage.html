<h1><b><i><u>moses</U></i></b></h1>
</header>
<P>I met moses on the street when i was coming from one of our organisation. I saw him straded and i felt attached, i don't know why, but i can't tell. So i decided to talk to him and when i was trying to great him, he seemed as if he was scared. so i went ahead and asked him if he could give me a chance and talk to him. He laughed and said,"you can't help me,you also want to mock me". I told him that i can help, if he wish to be helped.</p>
<p> I walked away and went my ways. But what i didn't know, moses was following me. I reached at my office, and while i was inside, i saw him and did not that i was seeing him from inside. I called my secretary and told her to call him. I invited him in and this time around, he smiled and he told me that, he thought that i maybe joking. So asked why he is in that state, because, he shabby and unhappy at his age?.</P>
<P>Moses started telling me his story and was not good to hear. But i had to tell him to stop thinking abaut the past. Because there is no good to stick to the past apart from blinding you from your future. And i encouraged him to work hard and be a resposimble man.</p>
<p>Moses's story was abaut loosing his both parents and he had no where to go because his late parents never showed him any of there relatives. I asked him to if he asked them the reason behind and he told me that his parents fell in love when they did not that they were related. After knowing it, their love was strong and could not allow them to set appart and besides that her mother, was already pregnant.</P>
<p>Moses parents decided to run away from the city to another city. And that is how he ended in this city kampala. Moses's parents died in car crush, while they coming back from visting him at school. When moses heard this news, he could not believe it, but it was true. They barried them in gorvement's land because they had no where to take them. So moses ended up dropping out from school.</P>
<p>Moses was 17yrs old when i met and he told me that he was begging on the road sides. And when i met him, he was lost in stress. He had nothing to eat and he did not know if he would eat. so that was his story that he told me that was not good to hear and the advice i first gave him to work hard</p>
<p>I gave him alot of examples of people who had related stories like his, and now they far in life. I told him that he can do it as well, that is if he change his behaviour and attitude. Moses seemed happy and i promised to help him if he can decide to go back to school. He said yes, but he has no money. I gave him a job in my organisation as a genitor. And i told him that he will be working whithot pay, and i will use that money to pay his school fees.</p>
<p>Moses liked the idea and after some couple of days, moses started school few years he had finnished his A level. After that, i told him that now he can start paying for him self at the universty, and he was very happy and he appreciated for everything.</p>
<p> The time i spent with moses was enough to change his attitude and make him a better person in this life. As i talk, moses is now a big man working in Uganda Wild Life Authority.</p>
<p> So my advice to people is to help others in need, because we do not need much to help. Thank you! and keep reading my next pages as i tell you more abaut my experience. You never no, maybe it may be of help.....
