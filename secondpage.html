<h1><b><i><u>my first experience as a counseler</U></i></b></h1>
</header>
<p>I can recall the first day when i was a sighned to a nursery school as a counseler.
<p></p>It was not easy to handle nursery pupils. first of all, to deal with kids, you need to be like a kid i meean you need to thick like one.
<p>so all the people wondered how i did it. It was simple because, i made them my friends,i made them feel like they can trust me and tell me their promblems.
</p>they felt so safe when i could talk to them because i told them that i was their friend. The purpose Is to allow me tO enter into their minds and tell me what could the issue to their poor perfomance, could be the teachers, or their parents.
so i found a strange gril, who was aged 4yrs. this girl had a mental illness called persimism.
maybe to tell you more abaut the this illness. this illness is an illness that is characterised by fear of facts. aperson with this tyupe oif illness, he or she has always a negative thinking abait things sorounding them.
so, i needed to trasnform this negativity into posititvity thinking. i had tell the girl that what she could think as bad, may not be the way way it looks.
she told me that the teachers hated her so much. And i told her no, that niot true. A very teacher is like your parent, and there is no parent on earth who would wake up hating his or her daughter.
</p>I asked her a quesion, do your parents hate you as well. she answered, yes and i asked her if she do some mistakes and find them selfs purnishing her. and she said yes, then asked her if she felt the same as if they hate her. she said no, i said why?
why do you think so? she answered, because their are my parents........and i said really. I told her that from today, you should always learn how to trust people and think of good things from them. If they are not bad, then it is you who is bad. i told her that GOD our creator wants to love each other and trust each other.
she looked at me and said that why can't i say that you are bad, then i told her maybe it is because  we are friends already. I told her, you should learn to love other people.
i had to go on giving her time to interact with her on occassions. And i had to tell my principle abaut the new i dea of my plan. And my plan was to talk to her abaut assessing the teachers on their way of teaching kids. I suspected them, either to be harsh to the kids or liking purnishing those who are sturbon and other things. This took me to think hard.
