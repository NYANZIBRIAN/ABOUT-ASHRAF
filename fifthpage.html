<h1><b><i><u>Me and Hajarh</U></i></b></h1>
</header>
<p>Hajarah is the girl i met in my home village, when i had gone to my holidays. Hajarah is the girl who was stigmatized because of her Disease. Hajarah, is a girl who was born with a <b> HIV AIDS</b> and was staying with her grandmother who was old and when i met her, she was crying at the river bank. I went ahead asked her to tell me what could be the trouble and she.........looked at me and said that no one in the villege loved her because of what she called as a curse on her.</p>
<p> I told her to go slow and tell me what could be the curse. She said to me that she born with HIV AIDS. I could not believe it because she looked so beautiful and young, stylished. So i wanted to help her and i asked her if she could allow me to help and she said that no one can save her. I looked in her and told her that i was going to help her and show her thwe other other side of the world. She seemed to have been traumatized with the sitigma. I had to arrange some time with her and talk on this matter of hers. i felt so attached to her like as if i new her before i was willingly to help her and console.</p>
<p> There is one thing i realised in my life, that i liked my work more than anything and if i could find any person who could seem troubled, i could just find my self helping and this time around i was caught up by Hajarah.</p>
<p> I mananged to meet up with Hajarah in quiet place, and i told her how she can stay long on earth than she thought. I told her how people's words are the most disease that kill peoplewho have HIV because of remaining behind with the other negative thinking that a person with a hiv can not live longer in this world. I went ahead and told her how she cn even be wuth a normal life like other girls. And that was if she could tell me that she was going to change and start listening to her self instead of other people's negative words. She looked at me and asked me what my name was.......imagine, we were talking when i had not yet introduced my self to her and she laughed. I tpld her my name and she and everything abaut my self. And she also went ahead to tell me all abaut her self and we continued with our conversation.</p>
<p> We had a good time together and she told me to that i was the first person to take her out even if it was just a conversation trying to help her oiut. She was so thrilled abaut that. I gave her my numberand told her to call me so that i can talk to her in case she is confused, if she does not know what to do. The next day, i went backto kampala were i was residing, my holidays were over and i had to return to work. After two days, she called me and told me that she was going to come to kampala that she had got a job. I was happy with her and when she called me that she was even coming to see me i was so happy as well. Atleast she was sounding very happy and inside me, and to me, that was enough for me to see a person back to her/his life is the best thing on earth that could happen to me and that is what i call <b>success.</b></p>
<p> Hajarah came and we finnaly met and she was so grateful that i was able to talk to her and that she saw me as an angel, i laughed and i told her that i was not an angel, but rather, i was someone who is becomes happy when he sees other people living happly. She told me that because of me, i was the one who gave the moralle to start thinking abaut her life again. Hajara as we talk is now married with two beatiful daughters and with a loving husband. She is leaving a life she could never think off. My advice, never you stigmatize any person who was born with HIV AIDS.</P>
